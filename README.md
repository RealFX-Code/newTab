# newTab

My new tab page, written in svelte, with SSR and all that good stuff!

This is opensource so you can add to it and change whatever you'd like.
Just know that you're limited to 4 cards. but subpages aren't too hard to add, considering you know svelte.js.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
